        <p>
            integrate computer-generated aspects into the environment throAugmented reality Placement of computer generated objects, imposing/ projecting images that can been seen in the real world through a device like a phone or glasses through the senses of sight, hearing and smell.

            Types of AR
        </h3>

        <p>
            AR can use cameras and visual markers to project/display an image to a person dependent on they are in the real world, and whether they have the ability to scan said shape/QR code. This is called called marker based AR. Another type of AR is markerless virtual reality, which is dependent on the user's location and position, to virtually form structures and objects in the nearby environment, as well as showing the route to the desination. superimposition AR, is AR that can replace the view of object partially or fully with a computer generated version of said object or something else altogether. An example of this is the service IKEA provides that allows users and potential buyers to put a virtually simulated piece of furniture into their home and see how it looks, instead of buying the physical product.
