        <p>
            Virtual reality is when the environment around the user is fully simulated and immersive with fully computer simulated environment through visual, auditory and touch effects, which make the user feel like it is in a different environment opposed to the one they're in. Virtual reality experience can occur in space, the ocean or completely different planets. This is usually used for gaming, and there are a variety of games for VR on sale, but VR can also be used for educational purposes, to put the user in a historic environment or allow the user to walk around somewhere on the opposite side of the world. There are many devices for VR that are currently on sale, some are as simplistic as the google cardboard, which allow the user's smartphone to be attached via specially shaped cardboard to the wearer's face. The more expensive versions of VR headsets use HDMI cables to connect to consoles or computers and immerse the user even more, with head and hand tracking. There are two different images being shown to each eye, to reflect how the user views the world, and allowing 2 2d images to form an evironment and immerse the user.
